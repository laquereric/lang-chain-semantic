# Python-Fuseki Integration Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the integration between Python and Apache Jena Fuseki, focusing on methods to connect Python applications to Fuseki SPARQL endpoints. This integration is crucial for the LangGraphSemantic project, which aims to store Pydantic models as SHACL shapes in RDF stores.

## Integration Methods

There are two primary approaches for connecting Python to Apache Jena Fuseki:

### 1. Using RDFLib with SPARQLUpdateStore

RDFLib provides a native Python interface for working with RDF data, and its `sparqlstore` module offers the `SPARQLUpdateStore` class for connecting to SPARQL endpoints that support both query and update operations.

```python
import rdflib
from rdflib import Graph, URIRef
from rdflib.plugins.stores import sparqlstore

# Define endpoints
query_endpoint = 'http://localhost:3030/dataset/query'
update_endpoint = 'http://localhost:3030/dataset/update'

# Create store and connect to endpoints
store = sparqlstore.SPARQLUpdateStore()
store.open((query_endpoint, update_endpoint))

# Create a graph with the store
default_graph = URIRef('http://example.org/default-graph')
ng = Graph(store, identifier=default_graph)

# Now you can use the graph to add/query data
ng.update('INSERT DATA { <http://example/s> <http://example/p> <http://example/o> }')
```

This approach integrates directly with RDFLib's Graph API, allowing for seamless interaction with RDF data using Python's native RDF library.

### 2. Using SPARQLWrapper

SPARQLWrapper provides a more direct way to send SPARQL queries and updates to endpoints, offering finer control over the HTTP requests.

```python
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper

# Create wrapper for the update endpoint
sparql = SPARQLWrapper('http://localhost:3030/dataset/update')

# Prepare and execute an update query
query_string = 'INSERT DATA {GRAPH <http://example.org/graph> {<http://example/s> <http://example/p> <http://example/o>}}'
sparql.setQuery(query_string)
sparql.method = 'POST'
sparql.query()
```

For more complex scenarios, SPARQLWrapper can be combined with RDFLib:

```python
import requests
import rdflib
from rdflib import Graph
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper

# Create a local graph
g = Graph()
g.parse(source='some_data.ttl', format='turtle')

# For each triple in the graph, send it to Fuseki
for s, p, o in g:
    query_string = f'INSERT DATA {{GRAPH <http://example.org/graph> {{{s.n3()} {p.n3()} {o.n3()}}}}}'
    sparql = SPARQLWrapper('http://localhost:3030/dataset/update')
    sparql.setQuery(query_string)
    sparql.method = 'POST'
    sparql.query()
```

## Error Handling Considerations

When working with Fuseki through Python, several common errors may occur:

1. **Connection Issues**: Ensure the Fuseki server is running and accessible at the specified endpoint URLs.

2. **Authentication**: If Fuseki is configured with security, appropriate authentication headers must be included.

3. **Query Formatting**: SPARQL queries must be properly formatted, especially when inserting RDF data with special characters.

4. **Transaction Management**: For large updates, consider using Fuseki's transaction support to ensure atomicity.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Connection Pooling**: For applications making frequent requests to Fuseki, implement connection pooling to reduce overhead.

2. **Batch Updates**: When inserting multiple triples, batch them into larger update operations rather than individual inserts.

3. **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic for transient network issues.

4. **Content Negotiation**: Specify appropriate content types for different RDF serialization formats.

5. **Namespace Management**: Use RDFLib's namespace management to make SPARQL queries more readable and maintainable.

## Integration with Pydantic

For the LangGraphSemantic project, we need to extend these integration methods to support converting Pydantic models to SHACL shapes. This will involve:

1. Analyzing Pydantic model structure and validation rules
2. Mapping Pydantic field types to appropriate RDF/SHACL constraints
3. Generating SHACL shape graphs from Pydantic models
4. Storing these shapes in Fuseki using the integration methods described above

The implementation will need to handle various Pydantic features such as nested models, field validators, and custom field types, translating them into equivalent SHACL constraints.
